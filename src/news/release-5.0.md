This release brings all of the features that were only available in develop until now, and more importantly a patch to address a security vulnerability.

## IMPORTANT notice regarding a security vulnerability in previous versions of the software

This version of PolyMC comes with a fix for a security vulnerability in the "import from zip" create instance option.

If for any reason you haven't updated to version **5.0 or above** do not use the "import from zip" option unless you are 100% sure that the file you're importing is safe (meaning you analysed it yourself and determined that it's safe, or you're the one who authored the file).

**Please** ensure in 'Help > About PolyMC' that you are running on at least version 5.0 before trying to use the "import from zip" option on any untrusted files.

As of this news post being created, Flathub still hasn't updated to 5.0, so seriously do make sure that you're on 5.0 before using the "import from zip" option. Flatpak users will likely have to wait up to a few hours for the PolyMC Flatpak to be updated on Flathub.
